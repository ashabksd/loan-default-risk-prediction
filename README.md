- Build a Logistic Regression model to predict defaults
- Evaluate model performance
- Visualize key patterns and results

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Key Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 80%
- Identified Credit History, Income, and Loan Amount as major predictors
